Although it's a bit nostalgic to use the Qlik's QlikView based download page it's better to have something newer :)

This web app is querying [qlik-download](https://github.com/orgs/qlik-download/repositories) organization and it's extracting the repositories and releases information to show them in a bit different way.

Still under development but the result can be seen at https://qlik-downloads.vercel.app/
